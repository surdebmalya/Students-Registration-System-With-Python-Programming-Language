# Students-Registration-System-With-Python-Programming-Language
Here, I have created a Students' Registration System by Python. You can Add new data to the database, Update data from the database, Search data in the database if there is such type of data already in the database or not, also you can reset the entry boxes by clicking the Reset button, you can also Delete any data.
The cool feature about this desktop application is that, you can also **DOWNLOAD** your Registration Card by clicking the Generate Reg. Card button.

## Mechanism:
Here I have used tkinter as a primary module for frontend development and sqlite3 for backend development. Also I have used PIL, os, datetime and time modules in this project. I have done a lot of errors handling and aimed for a proper execution of the desktop application.
